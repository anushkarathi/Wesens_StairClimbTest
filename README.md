# Wesens_StairClimbTest

This repository contains research work on the walking study done at Movement and Applied Imaging Lab through Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) at Boston University in fall 2022. This is a public repository to display code written by Anushka Rathi. Data of my own stair climb tests (3 trials) are provided for visualization. 

<strong>Project Description: </strong>	

This is an independent project based on a larger study, Wensens, which is chatacterizing and analyzing cadence in knee osteoarthritis participants after exercise-based intervention. 60 participants partook in the study which occuted over the course of 18 weeks, with 4 in-lab visitations. Using wearable sensors, specifically OPAL inertial measurement units, data was collected during several tests such as 6 meter walk test, stair climb test, step up test, and sit to stand test. 
In my independent project, I am observing changes in the stair climb data specifically, analyzing if participants improved upon the time it takes for them to ascenda and descend the stairs. Specifically, I am working to identify when the participant ascends and descends from the stairs and comparing among the first and last visit of the individual. 

<strong>Notes on Code File: </strong>	

The current code is shown only to identify specific information from the total OPAL sensor data. Specifically, I was only interested in the accelerometer and gyroscope data from the left foot, right foot, and lumbar sensors. I visualized this data as well as the Euler data in which I found the rotational angle from the lumbar sensor during my stair climb. This data will help in identifying when the turn occurs. Code is being currently modified, and will be updated as more progress in the project is made.
